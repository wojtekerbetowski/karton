# Mac Development Ansible Playbook
This repository is a combination of fork of Jeff Geerlings excellent repository: https://github.com/geerlingguy/mac-dev-playbook and fork of Richard van den Brand repository: https://github.com/ricbra/mac-dev-playbook. It is a stripped version suited to my needs.

For installation:

- Install X-code via Mac App Store
- Download a ZIP from this repository
- go to this folder and run ```sh run.sh ```


If you receive error with installing Ansible run script once again.
